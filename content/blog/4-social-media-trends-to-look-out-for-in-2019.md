Boy oh boy was 2018 a weird and wonderful year for social media. Facebook saw data breeches left, right and centre, yet still came out on top, finishing the year with double Instagram’s active users. Meanwhile, Twitter’s highly anticipated character limit expansion had mixed responses, actually disillusioning many of its users. Story-telling platforms were the real winners of 2018: Instagram, in particular, saw a rise in popularity of their story feature, with the new ‘Ask Me a Question’ feature encouraging more interaction on the platform. 

What were 2018’s biggest lessons in the world of social media? It’s out with the bots and in with the humans! Yes, Facebook’s automated message service for businesses is doing great, but, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal emphasises, users want people and platforms they can trust. That’s why real, human interaction is always going to be the way forward when it comes to social media. 

So, after a rather tumultuous year in social media, what can we expect from 2019? 

## Watch Out for Vero 

Launched in 2015, Vero’s user base has been rising rapidly in recent years. This new(ish) platform allows you to share everything you love: you can do the usual Facebook-style image and word posts, but you can also share destinations, books, movies and music you’re interested in. 

 The great thing about Vero is its audience controls. The platform allows you to categorise your connections, putting users into groups like ‘Close Friends’ or ‘Acquaintances’. This enables you to take control of who sees your posts. Speaking of privacy, Vero has no ads whatsoever! This means they never share your data or use algorithms. With people’s growing mistrust in social media, Vero’s sure to shine in the coming year! 

## Creative Paid Content

One in four Facebook pages now posts paid ads, while marketing departments have increased their social ad budgets by over 30% in the last year alone. This means there’s more competition than ever to be seen online. If you want your content to reach new audiences, therefore, you’ll need to get creative.

The past year has seen a rise in videos and more interactive forms of advertising. But what else can you do to be seen on social media? Targeting will be key! Companies will have more control over who sees their ads and ensure they’re not wasting time with uninterested users. We might also see new ways to advertise. Over the past year, Pinterest has introduced video ads, while Facebook has integrated Messenger advertising. This just goes to show the possibilities are endless and new doors will most certainly open in 2019!

## Moving to Private Spaces

Combined, the top messaging apps (which include WhatsApp, Skype and Facebook Messenger) have more than five _billion_ monthly active users! Businesses therefore need to move to private spaces, too. It’s not enough to activate Facebook Messenger for Business or set up a bot to auto-reply to customers. We’ve already established that people will be looking for human interaction in 2019. Your team therefore needs to actively encourage potential clients to enter these private spaces, where they ultimately feel safer. When someone comments on a post, for example, ask them to message you privately, where they are more likely to share private data, payment information, and have a better overall customer experience.  

## The Importance of Story Telling

Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook all offer story features that are booming. These offer both users and businesses the opportunity to share quick updates, boosting their engagement rates and number of followers. In recent weeks, Facebook has also added a story feature to all of its Groups, enabling all members to contribute and stay up-to-date with news and discussions. 

Could 2019 see stories appearing on other platforms? Quite possibly! We’ve seen Twitter trying to keep up with other channels, so we wouldn’t be surprised if a story feature was on the horizon. WhatsApp could very well test its own stories. We imagine this being far more private, perhaps just enabling members of group chats to form their own story. Watch this space!
