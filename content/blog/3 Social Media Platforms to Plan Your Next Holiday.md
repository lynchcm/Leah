###### Deciding where to go on holiday can be challenging, but social media makes it a little easier! While LinkedIn is useful for professional networking, and Facebook and WhatsApp are great for keeping in touch with friends, there are other platforms that can be extremely helpful when it comes to holiday planning. Here at NextStop24, our mission is to inspire travelers around the world. Using my expertise in the travel industry, I have taken a look at three image-heavy communities and summarised how they can make your holiday research a bit less stressful.

## **Instagram**

With more than 400 million active users, Instagram is one of the largest and fastest-growing social media platforms out there. It offers a collection of photos and short videos that mostly focus on fashion, food, art, and travel.![](/uploads/instagram1.jpeg)

When it comes to travel inspiration, there are two ways to use Instagram: you can research users that regularly post interesting travel content, or you can research and follow hashtags. These can be as broad or as specific as you like. Tags such as #travelinspo, #traveldestination, or #travelideas will reveal a huge range of destination pictures,making them a great start if you really have no idea where to go. If you already have a vague idea of your dream holiday, specific hashtags, such as #bestbeaches, #mountainsarecalling, or #cityviews, can be more helpful.![](/uploads/Instagram2.jpeg)

Personally, I prefer to follow smaller hashtags which aren’t been used very often. #Travel has been used more than 374 million times, making the available content quite overwhelming! I have also noticed that smaller, specific hashtags are often used by more dedicated Instagrammers, who share higher quality content.

## **Pinterest**

While Instagram is an interactive platform, Pinterest and Youtube are more typically used like search engines. You can still follow your favourite Pinterest or Youtube channels, but it’s not as common as on Instagram.![](/uploads/pinterest1.jpeg)

Similar to Instagram, Pinterest can be used to either follow travel-related users or search content via hashtags. You’ll find pins and boards (a collection of pins) related to the hashtag, which are often linked to blog posts and websites. That means you can get additional information on the user’s website right away, and don’t have to click off the image to find a link, as you do on Instagram.![](/uploads/pinterest2.jpeg)

I like to browse Pinterest hashtags like #budgettravel or #roadtrips, when I am looking for more generic travel ideas. Alternatively, you can search for tips on specific destinations such as #travelspain or #travelperu. The advantage of boards is that you won’t just see one photo, but a collection of content related to your hashtag!

## **Youtube**

Youtube isn’t only the second most popular search engine (behind Google), but also the largest and video-based social media platform, with more than 1 billion monthly visitors. Thanks to the platforms abundance of vlogs, Youtube is an extremely powerful tool for travel research.![](/uploads/youtube1.jpg)

I personally find Instagram and Pinterest more useful for general travel inspiration. Youtube, on the other hand, is great if you at least have an idea of the country you’d like to visit but need help finalising your detailed itinerary. There are also more generic travel videos, but I tend to find them less helpful.![](/uploads/youtube2.jpeg)

As with the aforementioned platforms, you can follow your favourite travel channels, or search for specific content. Depending on your search terms, you’ll find everything from quick summaries of “The Best Places to See in the US” to in-depth documentaries and personal travel advice.
