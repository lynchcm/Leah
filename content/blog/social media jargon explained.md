If you’re trying to get your business up and running on social media, you might feel a bit overwhelmed with all the new terms being thrown your way. From engagement to algorithm, there’s a whole bunch of weird and wonderful words to come to terms with. Don’t worry it’s not as challenging as you might think! We’re here to debunk six key social media terms to help your business flourish online.

## 1. Algorithm

Breathe… It’s the dreaded algorithm! It’s easiest to think of an algorithm as a formula fed to a computer, telling it to perform a certain function, or follow a specific set of rules. In the case of Facebook’s algorithm, the formula dictates which content appears highly in someone’s feed. Facebook changes this formula all the time, never giving an individual or company enough time to fully crack the code; however, there are a few things we know for sure.![Social Media Jargon Explained Algorithm](/uploads/Algorithm.jpeg "Social Media Jargon Explained Algorithm")

Firstly, the more someone interacts with a post, the more likely it is to appear highly on a feed. Secondly, there are different tiers to interaction: active and passive. Passive interaction is simply receiving a like from someone who is just scrolling through their feed. Active interaction is much more valuable. This requires someone to take an extra step; for example, sharing a post via Messenger or reacting to a post (e.g. laughing, loving, crying etc.) rather than simply liking it. These actions will help a post to appear higher and more often.

## 2. Conversion Rate

This term refers to the percentage of people who have actively done something after seeing a post. This most commonly means that someone has purchased something or signed up to a service as a direct result of a social media post (e.g. clicking through that post to a purchase page). It can also mean that someone has visited your site, filled out a form or followed another account because your post asked or instructed them to do so.

## 3. Engagement

Each platform defines this term slightly different, but, long story short, engagement is synonymous with interactions. On Facebook, engaging with a post can mean sharing, liking or responding by loving, laughing, crying etc. On Instagram, engagement only means liking or commenting, while Twitter determines engagement in terms of replying, liking and retweeting.

As we learnt in the algorithm section, engagement is important because the more engagement an account receives, the more likely its content is to be seen. However, platforms also boost an account’s visibility depending on how much it engages with other profiles. If you want your business to be found as often as possible, therefore, you should engage with other similar accounts or profiles that interest you, and always respond to comments on your own posts.

## 4. #Hashtags

Twitter, Instagram and, increasingly, Facebook use hashtags as a way to enable users to get their content seen. If enough people engage with your content that is using a certain hashtag, the post could eventually ‘trend’ under that hashtag title. This means it will appear at the top of searches for that given hashtag. Hashtag searches are also a great way for your company to find content that is relevant to engage with.

## 5. Influencer

A social media influencer is someone with a specific interest or talent who has a particularly large following. They tend to be experts in their field and are able to sway people’s behaviour and consumer habits. Companies often use influencers that are relevant to their sector to promote their brand. A restaurant, for example, might invite a famous food blogger in for a free meal if they post about it on their social media accounts.![Social Media Jargon Explained Influencer](/uploads/Influencer.jpeg "Social Media Jargon Explained Influencer")

Using influencers is a great way to boost your company’s reputation or following because their opinions are highly valued and trusted. There are lots of online agencies through which you can hire influencers. Alternatively, conduct a little Instagram or Twitter research using hashtags and keywords will quickly reveal an extensive list of popular users in your sector who you can get in contact with.

## 6. Reach

When looking at your analytics, you will see the term ‘reach’. This means the number of people, or unique individuals, who have seen your post. It does not matter how many times the person has viewed the post; for example, they could have seen it on their news feed and once again when their friend shared it, but your reach would only increase by one. Reach is often confused with impressions. The difference is that ‘impressions’ refers to the number of times a post has been seen. With the above example, then, your number of impressions would increase by two.![Social Media Jargon Explained Reach](/uploads/Reach.jpeg "Social Media Jargon Explained Reach")

There are two types of reach: organic and paid. Organic reach refers to the number of people who have seen a post without it being boosted by any kind of payment. Paid reach, meanwhile, refers to the number of unique individuals who have seen a piece of content because you have paid for it to be boosted.
