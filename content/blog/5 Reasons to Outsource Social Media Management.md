I get it: handing over usernames, passwords and control of your business’ accounts is daunting. Trusting someone you’ve maybe never met might even seem completely counter-intuitive. Yet thousands of successful companies of all shapes and sizes outsource their social media marketing to agencies and freelancers.

They choose to hand over responsibility for a range of reasons. Perhaps they don’t have the time to manage platforms themselves; maybe they can’t afford to pay an in-house manager; or perhaps they just don’t care to keep up with the tricks of the trade.

If you’re considering outsourcing your social media marketing, but need a little more convincing, keep reading for five awesome reasons to take the next step!

## 1. It’s Cheaper Than you Think

Hiring an in-house manager is both expensive and risky business. To hire an experienced social media manager, you’d need a budget of roughly £30,000 a year. To hire Simplicity, you’d need a _maximum_ of £4,000!![5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Cheaper Than You Think](/uploads/Money.jpeg "5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Cheaper Than You Think")

Sure, you could hire an unpaid intern or apprentice, but that’s an enormous risk. You’d have to test their grammar, spelling and understanding of the various platforms before they even start the job. Then, you would need someone to watch over their shoulder to ensure they’re not risking your company’s reputation. With Simplicity, you’ll never need to worry about the risk or the cost. Just sit back and enjoy!

## 2. Save Time

Ever sat at your desk on a Monday morning stressing about what to post throughout the week? Ever wasted a lunch break overthinking your caption? Ever laid wide awake at night stressing about your follower numbers and engagement rates? Okay, the last one might be over-exaggerating, but I don’t doubt you’ve spent _a lot_ of time thinking and worrying about your social media strategy. It’s time to wave goodbye to that stress!![5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Save Time](/uploads/Save time.jpeg "5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Save Time")

By outsourcing social media management, you’ll have more time to focus on sales, customer service, networking, employee satisfaction and other vital aspects of your business. You won’t have to spend hours playing with filters and you certainly won’t be distracted by notifications or the need to check how your post is performing. So, stop scrolling through memes and start outsourcing!

## 3. Get Expert Advice

By now, you’ve probably realised that social media is about so much more than just posting. To get the most out of your channels, you’ll need to conduct in-depth competitor research, develop a hashtag strategy, and think about the kind of content you’re going to post. That’s hard work, made even harder by the fact that social media algorithms are always changing. What you know to be true one minute might be totally redundant the next! Outsourcing social media to an expert will help you to figure out what, when and where to post and how to execute your social media strategy flawlessly.![5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Get Expert Advice](/uploads/Expert.jpeg "5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Get Expert Advice")

## 4. Perfect Timing

We’ve already established that social media takes a lot of time, but it’s also about the _right_ timing. If most of your followers are online at 15:00, but you always have an important meeting at that time, you’re going to miss out on some great conversations and potential sales.![5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Perfect Timing](/uploads/Perfect Timing-1.jpeg "5 Reasons to Outsource Social Media Management Perfect Timing")

By outsourcing social media management, you can rely on someone to figure out what the “right time” is and to be online to respond to questions, feedback and complaints. Speaking of complaints, you don’t want to be that company that makes a disgruntled customer wait 24 hours for a response, do you? An external social media manager will always be on hand to monitor notifications and ensure existing and potential clients receive a prompt response.

## 5. Get the Right Mix

Are you a huge fan of Twitter but can’t be bothered with Instagram? Do you tend to get carried away with pushing your products rather than sharing industry news? Outsourcing your social media needs will ensure you have the perfect mix when it comes to platforms and content. Experts can determine which channels are best for your sector or spread the weight evenly. Rather than only focusing on heavy sales copy, they’ll find other engaging content to share, such as blog posts and market trends. They can also devise special campaigns and competitions to ensure your platforms are as varied as possible with minimal effort at your end!
